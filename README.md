## Installing

A lot of stuff is hardcoded to fit my setup's needs so for the moment this is not something that is very portable. 

However a lot of things use a config file (named config.json most of the time) and SQL scripts to setup the database and such are provided as well as the hardware configuration.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcomed, since I'm aware that setting up a test environnement for this is very hard in some case, feel free to let me know so that I can merge it into a new branch for me to test or something.
