# SmartRoom

Software I wrote and use in my "SmartRoom" project.

## Installing

A lot of stuff is hardcoded to fit my setup's needs so for the moment this is not something that is portable nor customizable.

I wouldn't bother for now.

## Contributing

Feel free to send pull requests to fix my mess.
